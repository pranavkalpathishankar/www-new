What can you can expect at an LLVM Developers' Meeting?

- **Technical Talks**

  These 20-30 minute talks cover all topics from core infrastructure talks, to project's using LLVM's infrastructure. Attendees will take away technical information that could be pertinent to their project or general interest.

- **Tutorials**

  Tutorials are 50-60 minute sessions that dive down deep into a technical topic. Expect in depth examples and explanations.

- **Lightning Talks**

  These are fast 5 minute talks that give you a taste of a project or topic. Attendees will hear a wide range of topics and probably leave wanting to learn more.

- **Quick Talks**

  Quick 10 minute talks that dive a bit deeper into a topic, but not as deep as a Technical Talk.

- **Student Technical Talks**

  Graduate or Undergraduate students present their work using LLVM.

- **Panels**

  Panel sessions are guided discussions about a specific topic. The panel consists of ~3 developers who discuss a topic through prepared questions from a moderator. The audience is also given the opportunity to ask questions of the panel.

What types of people attend?

- Active developers of projects in the LLVM Umbrella (LLVM core, Clang, LLDB, libc++, compiler_rt, flang, lld, MLIR, etc).
- Anyone interested in using these as part of another project.
- Students and Researchers
- Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.
- Those interested in using compiler and toolchain technology in novel and interesting ways.

The LLVM Developers' Meeting strives to be the best conference to meet other LLVM developers and users.

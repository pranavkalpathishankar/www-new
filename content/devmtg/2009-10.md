## About

**Sponsored by [Apple](http://apple.com/), [Google](http://google.com/), [Adobe](http://www.adobe.com/), and [Qualcomm Incorporated](http://www.qualcomm.com/)**

The meeting serves as a forum for both [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) and [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) developers and users to get acquainted, lea rn how LLVM is used, and exchange ideas about LLVM and its (potential) applications. More broadly, we believe the event will be of particular interest to the following people:

- Active LLVM and Clang developers and users.
- Anyone interested in using LLVM or Clang.
- Compiler, programming language, and runtime enthusiasts.
- Those interested in using compiler technology in novel and interesting ways.

## Proceedings

The day was structured to have general overview/introduction talks about some major LLVM subsystems and talks on applications of LLVM for various specific projects.

This page lists all of the slides and videos for all of the talks of the day. The talks were held in two rooms (in one room we only were able to record a screencast), in the other room we have full video. The mobile versions of the videos are in a generic 'H.264' container, and the computer versions are in 'QuickTime' format.
